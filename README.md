GLSEC 2013 - Name Tag Creation
==============================
Rack based Sinatra application to help create the spreadsheet needed to create nametags.

Reasoning
---------
Why create an application to do this when there is an Excel export? Simple, the export has a ton of information that we don't need. Further, the name is a concatenated export of "Last Name, First Name" and we need them separated.

When I tried to look through the options in RegOnline to create a custom export, the menus were confusing and information was hard to come by. So I figured I had an export with the information I needed, why not pull it out from there?

Purpose
-------
So rather than creating the list by hand, I thought a simple utility - even if super specialized for the RegOnline export and our needs - would help simplify the process.

Future
------
If others wish to use this utility for their RegOnline attendee exports to create custom spreadsheets/csv's, just inbox me and I will put it in my queue.
