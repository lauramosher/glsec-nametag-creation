%h1 Convert RegOnline .csv file

%p 
	.span.label.label-warning WARNING!
	You MUST open the .xls file that you export and resave as a .csv file. I did not want to use very many external libraries for this quick "work around" utility. I'll add file support later.

	%form{:action => "/export.csv", :method => :post, :enctype=>"multipart/form-data", :class => "form-horizontal"}

				RegOnline Export (converted to .csv)
			.controls
				%input{:type => :file, :name => "file"}
		.control-group

.alert.alert-info Once you hit "Convert," an export.csv file will automatically be downloaded for your use. Nothing will be stored on the server.
